# Radio burst \- Justification File

* Are your original Aesthetics supported?  
  * Yes, we playtested a lot, and we found that players generally thought the music was good, and the gameplay was exciting.   
  * Being a “pick up and play” game is a bit more vague, but we think that we achieved it with a short level that can be played in a quick 3 minutes\!   
  * The level is replay-able, and you can always shoot for that perfect run, without it taking too long.  
* Are the stated Dynamics playable?  
  * Yes. While the dynamics did indeed change from the original idea, the intention mostly stayed the same.  
  * The player can input their movements to move in a grid-based manner.  
  * The movements must be in rhythm (though with an added setting to bypass this if it’s more frustrating than fun)  
  * The player needing to keep moving was removed, although still definitely present in the final product, with optimal play forcing the player to keep moving.  
  * The music is in time with the level, making for a rhythmic experience.  
  * Moving double the speed with a toggle did not make it into the full game (more on that below).  
  * Parry-able projectiles did not make it into the full game (more on that below).  
* How is it different from what you set out to do?  
  * We tried to have the player never stop moving and give them the ability to double their speed.   
  * Both of these mechanics were removed in favor of having to tap the movement buttons on beat to move.   
  * The “never stopping” was made to be more of a suggestion instead of being forced, when you move you gain score and multiplier.  
  * Tying the score and multiplier to player movement will incentivize the player to always move without forcing them to do so, adding another layer of choices for the player.   
  * It was planned to add parry-able projectiles, but as the project moved forward we realized that it would not make sense in this game, so the idea was axed.   
  * The core look and sound remain the same as what was originally planned.   
  * In order to help the player keep to the rhythm, the stage pulses in beat with the music in order to act as a metronome, this was not planned originally.
